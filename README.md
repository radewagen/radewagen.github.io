Hi curious visitor.   

You won't find much on this webpage, but a collection of resources that I can highly recommend.

- Paul Graham's notes on life http://www.paulgraham.com/vb.html and what to do (or not to do) http://www.paulgraham.com/todo.html
- Nice little game, explaining trust from a game theory perspective: https://ncase.me/trust/ 
- Online book, teaching some grand ideas about CS with nice interactive visualizations: https://natureofcode.com/book/chapter-9-the-evolution-of-code/


- Current side project: https://snowboard.software/
