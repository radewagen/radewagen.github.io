# Hi curious visitor.   

You won't find much on this webpage, but a collection of resources that I can highly recommend.

- Paul Graham's [notes on life](http://www.paulgraham.com/vb.html) and what [to do](http://www.paulgraham.com/todo.html) (or not to do) 
- [Nice little game]( https://ncase.me/trust/ ), explaining trust from a game theory perspective
- [Online book] (https://natureofcode.com/book/chapter-9-the-evolution-of-code/), teaching some grand ideas about CS with nice interactive visualizations
